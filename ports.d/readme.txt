This is to check and close specific port(well know ports), closing the port will halt the associated process.
On some ports, you will notice if you closed a port and still open, it means that a process still running and open a new port.

To fully close/block a port, use firewall to block the port.

The main script is ports.sh, each script can be run by itself.
